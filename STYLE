Proposed Guidelines:

License Heading
    All source files must begin with the licensing information shown at the top 
    of this file.

Maximum line width
    All lines must be less than 80 characters in width. A long line in fortran
    source files should be continued with an ampersand. For example:
    
        k = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10)  &
            * (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10)
            
Tabs vs. spaces
    Use spaces for all alignments. Indentation uses 4 spaces instead of a tab.
    Set your text editor to emit 4 spaces when you press the tab key. Do loops 
    should be indented 4 spaces.
  
    do i = 1, N
        {Do something}
    end do
  
    Sequential loops may be aligned together, as shown below. 
    do i = 1, Nx
    do j = 1, Ny
        {Do something}
    end do
    end do
  
    However, use this style if the do loops do not appear together
    do i = 1, Nx
        {Do something}
        do j = 1, Ny
            {Do something else}
        end do
    end do
